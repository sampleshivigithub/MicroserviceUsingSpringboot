This project was created to demo using multiple microservices to develop a small web application that can do basic authentication, authorization, and create a basic database.

1️⃣ Understanding the Testing Process in Microservices
Testing in microservices is different from monolithic applications because:

Each service is independent and needs to be tested separately.
There are multiple layers of testing, including unit tests, integration tests, contract tests, and end-to-end tests.
Services communicate via APIs, so testing API interactions is crucial.

2️⃣ Types of Testing in Your Project
Based on the course topics, your project testing likely includes:

✅ Unit Testing
Each microservice (Quiz, Questions, etc.) should have its own unit tests.
Use JUnit and Mockito for Java-based services.
Test business logic and database operations.

✅ Integration Testing
Ensures that multiple microservices communicate properly.
Uses tools like Testcontainers (for testing with real databases) and Spring Boot Test.

✅ Service Communication Testing
Since services communicate via REST APIs or message brokers, API testing tools like Postman, RestAssured, or WireMock can be used.
If you're using Kafka/RabbitMQ, testing should ensure messages are produced and consumed correctly.

✅ API Gateway Testing
Since you have implemented an API Gateway, it should be tested for:
Correct routing of requests.
Load balancing.
Authentication and authorization (if implemented).

3️⃣ Testing Tools and Frameworks for Java-Based Microservices
Since you're preparing for a Java Developer Role, these are some testing frameworks you should get familiar with:
JUnit + Mockito → For unit testing.
Spring Boot Test → For integration testing.
RestAssured → For API testing.
Testcontainers → For database testing.
WireMock → For mocking external services.

4️⃣ Steps to Test Your Microservices Project
Run unit tests → Check if each service works independently.
Test database interactions → Ensure your microservices store and retrieve data correctly.
Check service communication → Make API calls between microservices.
Validate API Gateway functionality → Ensure it routes requests correctly.
Perform end-to-end testing → Test the system as a whole.

5️⃣ End-to-End Testing with Postman
Since you have multiple microservices, you should:
Use Postman to test API calls.
Validate responses from different services (Quiz, Questions).
Ensure API Gateway routes requests correctly.
